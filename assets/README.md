# Spotify to Soundpad

This application lets you synchronize Spotify with Soundpad.

## How to use it

Make sure both Spotify and Soundpad are running then launch `spotify-to-soundpad.exe`. A window will pop up - leave that running in the background.

Find a song in Spotify and play it. The app will detect the new song, pause Spotify, download an mp3 version of it from YouTube, add it to Soundpad and play it in Soundpad.

At the end of the song in Soundpad it will automatically tell Spotify to play the next song (which repeats the above process).

## Where does it download the songs to?

Your music folder eg. `C:/Users/jdog/Music/spotify-to-soundpad/Caravan Palace - Lone Digger.mp3`
