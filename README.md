# Getting Started

1. enable "youtube data api" in google cloud console
2. create credentials (public data) and copy the API key
3. install python 3.10 from windows store (run `python` command in terminal)

# Notes

- dumps MP3 files into Music folder
- strips out weird characters from filenames

## C# app

Needed for sending play/pause commands for Spotify

## YouTube Downloading

`youtube-dl` is too slow. Using `yt-dlp` which is a faster fork
